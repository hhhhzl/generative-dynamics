# Demonstration gallery

The framework README uses one continuous, silent gallery of **44 native paper
and hardware clips**. A camera visits five groups, then pulls back to the whole
wall before returning to the first group. Wider gutters separate the groups.
There are no added titles, captions, logos or labels inside the animation.

| Order | Group | Native footage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **MDOC** | Four single-robot scenes and four multi-robot CBS scenes from the original MDOC project. |
| 2 | **MD-COAS** | Two planar scenes (including the paper’s L10, seed 8 example) and 7-DoF avoidance, each pairing diffusion with 20 candidate trajectories, beside the D3IL execution environment. |
| 3 | **2GO** | Two quadruped stepping-stone scenes and four humanoid corridor variants. |
| 4 | **MGA** | Twelve surface geometry/material variants, three peg-insertion variants and three humanoid contact tasks. |
| 5 | **Hardware** | 2GO humanoid execution, plus MGA rigid/curved/compliant scanning and peg insertion. |

## Website playback

This website presents individual clips rather than the README’s moving gallery.
All 2GO animations retain their original frame timing, and hardware excerpts
retain the original source-video timing. They loop silently without added
acceleration. The homepage hero combines the original MGA contact and 2GO
locomotion simulations with real G1 hardware using AR virtual obstacles and MGA
hardware surface interaction and insertion. The gallery retains all six original
research demonstrations and adds three hardware clips.

| Website clip | Preserved source interval |
| --- | --- |
| 2GO Go2 stepping stones | Full original GIF, 16.28 seconds |
| 2GO G1 corridor | Full original GIF, 34.56 seconds |
| 2GO real G1 | 92–112 seconds of the original hardware video, played over 20 seconds |
| MGA hardware excerpts | 12–24 seconds of the original deployment video, played over 12 seconds |

Other website planning and simulation clips retain presentation timing.
Source animation timing does not establish planning latency or synchronize
separate experiments. See each [result’s playback context](/results/).

## README gallery files and regeneration

- `showcase.gif` is the GitHub-compatible looping animation.
- `showcase.mp4` is the 1344 × 992 video with the same 24-second camera journey.
- `showcase-poster.png` shows the complete gallery in one frame.
- `architecture.svg` is the separately editable framework diagram.

The compact source clips are checked in under `showcase_sources/v2/`.
[manifest.json](https://github.com/hhhhzl/genedynamics/blob/main/docs/assets/showcase_sources/v2/manifest.json) records all 44 checksums,
original source identities, crop bounds, selected time ranges and playback
normalization. It uses symbolic source roots rather than personal machine paths.
The gallery can be rebuilt without a simulator or the original paper folders:

```bash
python -m pip install Pillow numpy imageio-ffmpeg
python scripts/visualizations/build_readme_showcase.py
```

Within MD-COAS, each column pairs the diffusion process above with the generated
candidate trajectories below. The planar views use L6/seed 0 and L10/seed 8.
The arm view uses L1/seed 0 and shows the TCP projection of all 20 planned
7-DoF trajectories, sourced from `trajectory_modes_plan.gif` rather than the
execution trace. Candidate animations reveal the paths over their horizon;
they are separate runs from the adjacent D3IL execution footage.

To inspect the composition before encoding:

```bash
python scripts/visualizations/build_readme_showcase.py \
  --preview-only --output /tmp/generative-gallery-preview
```

The separate `prepare_readme_media.py` script recreates the compact inputs when
original source folders are available. Its `--help` documents the source-root
overrides. It reads those folders and writes only to the requested output path.

## Presentation and release boundaries

All robot motion, diffusion trajectories and scene geometry come from the
original footage. Colors are preserved. Crops remove source titles, subtitles,
rulers, plots and empty margins; frames retain their aspect ratios. No robot
motion or scientific data is synthesized. In the README gallery, clips loop and their selected time
ranges are rescaled to six seconds for simulation/planning or eight seconds for
hardware. Playback and the moving gallery camera do **not** indicate execution
latency, synchronization between experiments or real-time performance.

The gallery presents the broader research behind the framework. Its contents
are not a device-support or reproduction matrix:

- The original MDOC project includes CBS multi-robot coordination. This V1
  repository exposes the single-robot planning component; the multi-robot
  application remains in the [MDOC project](https://github.com/hhhhzl/mdoc).
- MGA's humanoid contact tasks are paper demonstrations. Humanoid walking/push
  and MGA GPU qualification remain follow-up work for this release.
- The MGA `soft_*` footage shows a rigid robot arm contacting compliant
  material. It does not introduce the excluded soft-robot or co-design systems.
- Hardware footage demonstrates the research systems used for the papers;
  installing V1 alone does not establish a qualified driver/controller setup
  for every robot shown.

validated paths.
