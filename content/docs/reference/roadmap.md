# 🗺️ Roadmap

Checked items are available in V1. Unchecked items are planned work; current
robot and device support is listed in [compatibility](/docs/compatibility).

## Available

- [x] Policy learning, learned diffusion and reusable priors
- [x] JAX planning and composable constraints
- [x] Six task families and planner baselines
- [x] Configured experiments, metrics, traces and replay

## Next

- [ ] MGA CUDA qualification and humanoid walking/push
- [ ] Torch planner parity and device-resident array transfers
- [ ] Rust/C++ control and I/O components
- [ ] Panda/xArm7 deployment controllers and `ros2_control` actions
- [ ] Async planning/control, command expiry and fault recovery
- [ ] Reproducible hardware latency, reliability and task-quality benchmarks

## Explore

- [ ] MuJoCo Warp rollout integration
- [ ] Action-chunk/VLA proposals through OpenPI and LeRobot adapters
- [ ] Live perception, timestamped geometry and dynamic scenes
