# Planners and algorithm sources

Choose a task configuration, then change its planner while keeping the task,
constraints, and evaluation tools. **Ours** identifies algorithms developed by
the GenerativeDynamics authors. The list below follows the algorithm names in
their papers; implementation keys are documented separately.

identifies the source algorithm; it does not imply that every upstream
experiment, robot, or theoretical assumption is reproduced by this integration.

## Names used in code

- **MD-COAS** uses the historical `cfsmbd` / `cfsmbd_full` implementation keys.
  CFS-MBD is not a separate paper algorithm in this catalogue. The main
  `mdcoas.yaml` recipe enables adaptive scheduling; individual CFS configurations
  can select a different constraint projection or schedule.
- **2GO** uses the solver key `2go`; its task configuration filenames use
  `twogo`. These refer to the same algorithm.
- **DIAL-MPC** uses the solver key `dial`.
- **DPCC** trajectory-selection settings, task dimensions, and constraint
  variants configure one integration rather than introducing new planners.
- `d3il_unified` is an environment/solver execution adapter. It selects the
  algorithm through `method_params.solver`.
- `model_based_only`, `standalone_rl`, and the MGA ablation configurations are
  comparison settings. They are not additional named paper algorithms.
- CEM and CMA-ES implementations exist in the source tree, but this V1
  catalogue lists algorithms with published task configurations. Source
  availability alone does not establish a supported task recipe.

## Integration details

MDOC's original paper and project include multi-robot coordination through
Conflict-Based Search. The V1 recipes in this repository expose its
single-robot planning component; use the linked original project for the
published multi-robot application.

The contact-control DIAL-MPC and PegasusFlow baselines retain their sampling
mechanisms under the shared task and rollout interface. ATACOM trains and
executes a policy in tangent-action coordinates. ISSA filters nominal policy
actions through simulator queries. These are task integrations, so comparisons
should report their configuration, learned assets, and total rollout cost.

SafeDiffuser uses a local CBF safety correction inside the vendored learned
diffusion architecture. DPCC likewise uses its dedicated learned-model
integration. Both require their optional Torch dependencies and trained assets.

MGA stands for **Manifold Generative Annealing**. Its manuscript is titled
*Manifold Generative Annealing for Contact Constraint-aware Impedance Control
with Reinforcement Learning Prior*. A public paper URL has not been verified,
so this catalogue links the implementation. V1 qualifies its CPU path; GPU
qualification and humanoid push/walking remain deferred.
