# Constraint solvers

Compose [CBF action filters](https://github.com/hhhhzl/genedynamics/tree/main/genedynamics/core/constraints/action_filters),
[CFS trajectory projections](https://github.com/hhhhzl/genedynamics/blob/main/genedynamics/core/constraints/action_filters/cfs_qp_full.py)
and [adaptive augmented-Lagrangian scheduling](https://github.com/hhhhzl/genedynamics/blob/main/genedynamics/core/constraints/schedulers/ConstraintScheduler/almadaptive/alm_adaptive.py)
with the numerical interfaces below.

Constraints participate **inside the sampling loop**. A candidate batch has
shape `(N, H, action_dim)`: filters correct candidate actions, rollout residuals
change their weights, and manifold geometry shapes the next generative update.
MDOC, MD-COAS, 2GO and MGA compose these operations differently. See
[Batched constraints and generative samples](/docs/batched-constraints)
for the data flow, tensor shapes, trained-diffusion DPCC/SafeDiffuser paths and
an executable JAX example.

## Compose constraint handling

| Component | Use it for | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CBF filters** | Correcting actions along rollouts, including Cartesian-to-joint Jacobian lifting. | [Closed-form](https://github.com/hhhhzl/genedynamics/blob/main/genedynamics/core/constraints/action_filters/cbf_closed_form.py) · [QP filter](https://github.com/hhhhzl/genedynamics/blob/main/genedynamics/core/constraints/action_filters/cbf_qp.py) · [Joint lift](https://github.com/hhhhzl/genedynamics/blob/main/genedynamics/core/constraints/action_filters/cbf_qp_joint_lift.py) |
| **CFS projections** | Building local obstacle halfspaces and correcting per-step or full-horizon actions. | [Per step](https://github.com/hhhhzl/genedynamics/blob/main/genedynamics/core/constraints/action_filters/cfs_qp_perstep.py) · [Full horizon](https://github.com/hhhhzl/genedynamics/blob/main/genedynamics/core/constraints/action_filters/cfs_qp_full.py) · [Joint lift](https://github.com/hhhhzl/genedynamics/blob/main/genedynamics/core/constraints/convexify/cfs/action_joint_lift.py) |
| **Adaptive ALM scheduling** | Updating feasibility penalties and projection effort from constraint feedback. | [ALMAdaptiveConstraintScheduler](https://github.com/hhhhzl/genedynamics/blob/main/genedynamics/core/constraints/schedulers/ConstraintScheduler/almadaptive/alm_adaptive.py) |

CBF and CFS identify constraint-handling methods; the numerical solver is a
separate choice. See the original [CBF-QP paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06408)
and [CFS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00627) for the underlying formulations,
then inspect [MDOC and MD-COAS recipes](/docs/recipes) for their integration.

## Choose the right solve path

- **Batching follows the integration.** JAX filters map over candidate
  trajectories with `vmap`; a state-dependent rollout uses `scan` over time.
  Full-horizon CFS couples the actions within each trajectory. These are
  different from solving one independent QP for every `(sample, time)` pair.
- **Closed form is specialized.** Its halfspace and box paths perform Euclidean
  projection and clipping. They are not general QP solves for arbitrary Hessians.
- **Fast JAX helpers are approximate projections.** Functions such as
  `solve_slack_qp_jax()` use finite, projection-style updates. They are distinct
  from the `JAXOPTOsqpSolver.solve_qp()` interface that invokes `jaxopt.OSQP`.
- **Host-facing QP wrappers are separate.** `OSQPSolver` and `CVXOPTSolver` use
  CPU Python/NumPy interfaces. The current `JAXOPTOsqpSolver.solve_qp()` wrapper
  also returns NumPy arrays. Do not put these wrappers directly inside a
  `jax.jit`/`vmap` sampling loop; use the existing pure-JAX filter path or an
  explicit host-side integration.
- **QPAX is an optional operator fallback.** The
  [per-step operator](https://github.com/hhhhzl/genedynamics/blob/main/genedynamics/core/constraints/operators/qp/per_step_filter.py)
  can call QPAX; this repository does not provide a separate QPAX solver class.

Use the [compatibility matrix](/docs/compatibility) for backend and device status.
Constraint margins, slack, iteration limits and the selected task determine the
behavior of an integration; a solver name alone does not establish task safety
or numerical convergence.
